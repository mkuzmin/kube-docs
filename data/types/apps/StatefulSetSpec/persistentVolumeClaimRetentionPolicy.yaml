  original: persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes the lifecycle of persistent
    volume claims created from volumeClaimTemplates. By default, all persistent volume
    claims are created as needed and retained until manually deleted. This policy
    allows the lifecycle to be altered, for example by deleting persistent volume
    claims when their stateful set is deleted, or when their pod is scaled down.
