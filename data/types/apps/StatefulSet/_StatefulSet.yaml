    StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
      - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
      - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
    
    The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
