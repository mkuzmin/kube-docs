  original: 'The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
    Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
    Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be
    0. Defaults to 1. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that
    enable the MaxUnavailableStatefulSet feature. The field applies to all pods in
    the range 0 to Replicas-1. That means if there is any unavailable pod in the range
    0 to Replicas-1, it will be counted towards MaxUnavailable.'
