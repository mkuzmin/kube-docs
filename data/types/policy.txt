policy/PodDisruptionBudget/_PodDisruptionBudget.yaml
PodDisruptionBudget is an object to define the max disruption that can be caused to a collection of pods
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudget/spec.yaml
Specification of the desired behavior of the PodDisruptionBudget.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudget/status.yaml
Most recently observed status of the PodDisruptionBudget.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetSpec/_PodDisruptionBudgetSpec.yaml
PodDisruptionBudgetSpec is a description of a PodDisruptionBudget.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetSpec/maxUnavailable.yaml
An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable".
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetSpec/minAvailable.yaml
An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%".
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetSpec/selector.yaml
Label query over pods whose evictions are managed by the disruption budget. A null selector will match no pods, while an empty ({}) selector will select all pods within the namespace.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/_PodDisruptionBudgetStatus.yaml
PodDisruptionBudgetStatus represents information about the status of a PodDisruptionBudget. Status may trail the actual state of a system.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/currentHealthy.yaml
current number of healthy pods
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/desiredHealthy.yaml
minimum desired number of healthy pods
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/disruptedPods.yaml
DisruptedPods contains information about pods whose eviction was processed by the API server eviction subresource handler but has not yet been observed by the PodDisruptionBudget controller. A pod will be in this map from the time when the API server processed the eviction request to the time when the pod is seen by PDB controller as having been marked for deletion (or after a timeout). The key in the map is the name of the pod and the value is the time when the API server processed the eviction request. If the deletion didn't occur and a pod is still there it will be removed from the list automatically by PodDisruptionBudget controller after some time. If everything goes smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time. Large number of entries in the map may indicate problems with pod deletions.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/disruptionsAllowed.yaml
Number of pod disruptions that are currently allowed.
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/expectedPods.yaml
total number of pods counted by this disruption budget
===
policy/PodDisruptionBudgetStatus/observedGeneration.yaml
Most recent generation observed when updating this PDB status. DisruptionsAllowed and other status information is valid only if observedGeneration equals to PDB's object generation.
