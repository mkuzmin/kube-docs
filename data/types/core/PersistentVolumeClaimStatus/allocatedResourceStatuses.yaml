    allocatedResourceStatuses stores status of resource being resized for the given PVC. Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:
    	* Un-prefixed keys:
    		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
    	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
    Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.

    ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
    	- ControllerResizeInProgress:
    		State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
    	- ControllerResizeFailed:
    		State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
    	- NodeResizePending:
    		State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
    		volume is needed on the node.
    	- NodeResizeInProgress:
    		State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
    	- NodeResizeFailed:
    		State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
    		NodeResizeFailed.
    For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
    	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
         - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"
         - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizePending"
         - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
         - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
    When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.

    A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources associated with PVC.

    This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature.
