  original: 'Secrets is a list of the secrets in the same namespace that pods running
    using this ServiceAccount are allowed to use. Pods are only limited to this list
    if this service account has a "kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets" annotation
    set to "true". The "kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets" annotation is deprecated
    since v1.32. Prefer separate namespaces to isolate access to mounted secrets.
    This field should not be used to find auto-generated service account token secrets
    for use outside of pods. Instead, tokens can be requested directly using the TokenRequest
    API, or service account token secrets can be manually created. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret'
