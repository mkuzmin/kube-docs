  original: Name of VolumeAttributesClass to which this persistent volume belongs.
    Empty value is not allowed. When this field is not set, it indicates that this
    volume does not belong to any VolumeAttributesClass. This field is mutable and
    can be changed by the CSI driver after a volume has been updated successfully
    to a new class. For an unbound PersistentVolume, the volumeAttributesClassName
    will be matched with unbound PersistentVolumeClaims during the binding process.
