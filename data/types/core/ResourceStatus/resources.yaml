  original: List of unique resources health. Each element in the list contains an
    unique resource ID and its health. At a minimum, for the lifetime of a Pod, resource
    ID must uniquely identify the resource allocated to the Pod on the Node. If other
    Pod on the same Node reports the status with the same resource ID, it must be
    the same resource they share. See ResourceID type definition for a specific format
    it has in various use cases.
