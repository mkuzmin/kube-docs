  original: 'List of addresses reachable to the node. Queried from cloud provider,
    if available. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/node-status/#addresses
    Note: This field is declared as mergeable, but the merge key is not sufficiently
    unique, which can cause data corruption when it is merged. Callers should instead
    use a full-replacement patch. See https://pr.k8s.io/79391 for an example. Consumers
    should assume that addresses can change during the lifetime of a Node. However,
    there are some exceptions where this may not be possible, such as Pods that inherit
    a Node''s address in its own status or consumers of the downward API (status.hostIP).'
