    maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the certificate.

    Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it generates for this projection.

    If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable value is 7862400 (91 days).

    The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600 seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver. `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime longer than 24 hours.
