    Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.
    
    The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks. The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private key.
    
    The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).
    
    Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you project them to separate files, your application code will need to additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.
