  original: 'Represents a list of rules to be checked to determine if the container
    should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches
    a container exit condition, the remaining rules are ignored. If no rule matches
    the container exit condition, the Container-level restart policy determines the
    whether the container is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules: - At most
    20 rules are allowed. - Rules can have the same action. - Identical rules are
    not forbidden in validations. When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy
    explicitly even it if matches the Pod''s RestartPolicy.'
