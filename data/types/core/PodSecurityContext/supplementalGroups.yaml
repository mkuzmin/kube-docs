description:
  original: A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in
    addition to the container's primary GID and fsGroup (if specified).  If the SupplementalGroupsPolicy
    feature is enabled, the supplementalGroupsPolicy field determines whether these
    are in addition to or instead of any group memberships defined in the container
    image. If unspecified, no additional groups are added, though group memberships
    defined in the container image may still be used, depending on the supplementalGroupsPolicy
    field. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
