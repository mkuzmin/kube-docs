    Health of the resource. can be one of:
     - Healthy: operates as normal
     - Unhealthy: reported unhealthy. We consider this a temporary health issue
                  since we do not have a mechanism today to distinguish
                  temporary and permanent issues.
     - Unknown: The status cannot be determined.
                For example, Device Plugin got unregistered and hasn't been re-registered since.

    In future we may want to introduce the PermanentlyUnhealthy Status.
