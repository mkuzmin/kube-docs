    Endpoints is a collection of endpoints that implement the actual service. Example:

    	 Name: "mysvc",
    	 Subsets: [
    	   {
    	     Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
    	     Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
    	   },
    	   {
    	     Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.3.3"}],
    	     Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 93}, {"name": "b", "port": 76}]
    	   },
    	]

    Endpoints is a legacy API and does not contain information about all Service features. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice for complete information about Service endpoints.

    Deprecated: This API is deprecated in v1.33+. Use discoveryv1.EndpointSlice.
