    HostnameOverride specifies an explicit override for the pod's hostname as perceived by the pod. This field only specifies the pod's hostname and does not affect its DNS records. When this field is set to a non-empty string: - It takes precedence over the values set in `hostname` and `subdomain`. - The Pod's hostname will be set to this value. - `setHostnameAsFQDN` must be nil or set to false. - `hostNetwork` must be set to false.

    This field must be a valid DNS subdomain as defined in RFC 1123 and contain at most 64 characters. Requires the HostnameOverride feature gate to be enabled.
