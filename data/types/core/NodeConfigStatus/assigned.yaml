  original: Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When
    Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config
    payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node
    refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this record
    in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been checkpointed
    to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the Assigned config the
    Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload identified by
    Assigned.
