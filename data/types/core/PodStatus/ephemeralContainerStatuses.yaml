    Statuses for any ephemeral containers that have run in this pod. Each ephemeral container in the pod should have at most one status in this list, and all statuses should be for containers in the pod. However this is not enforced. If a status for a non-existent container is present in the list, or the list has duplicate names, the behavior of various Kubernetes components is not defined and those statuses might be ignored.
