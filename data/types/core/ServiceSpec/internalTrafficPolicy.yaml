  original: InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
    receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods only
    want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod, dropping
    the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value, "Cluster", uses
    the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by
    topology and other features).
