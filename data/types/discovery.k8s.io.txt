discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/_Endpoint.yaml
Endpoint represents a single logical "backend" implementing a service.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/addresses.yaml
addresses of this endpoint. For EndpointSlices of addressType "IPv4" or "IPv6", the values are IP addresses in canonical form. The syntax and semantics of other addressType values are not defined. This must contain at least one address but no more than 100. EndpointSlices generated by the EndpointSlice controller will always have exactly 1 address. No semantics are defined for additional addresses beyond the first, and kube-proxy does not look at them.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/conditions.yaml
conditions contains information about the current status of the endpoint.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/deprecatedTopology.yaml
deprecatedTopology contains topology information part of the v1beta1 API. This field is deprecated, and will be removed when the v1beta1 API is removed (no sooner than kubernetes v1.24).  While this field can hold values, it is not writable through the v1 API, and any attempts to write to it will be silently ignored. Topology information can be found in the zone and nodeName fields instead.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/hints.yaml
hints contains information associated with how an endpoint should be consumed.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/hostname.yaml
hostname of this endpoint. This field may be used by consumers of endpoints to distinguish endpoints from each other (e.g. in DNS names). Multiple endpoints which use the same hostname should be considered fungible (e.g. multiple A values in DNS). Must be lowercase and pass DNS Label (RFC 1123) validation.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/nodeName.yaml
nodeName represents the name of the Node hosting this endpoint. This can be used to determine endpoints local to a Node.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/targetRef.yaml
targetRef is a reference to a Kubernetes object that represents this endpoint.
===
discovery.k8s.io/Endpoint/zone.yaml
zone is the name of the Zone this endpoint exists in.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointConditions/_EndpointConditions.yaml
EndpointConditions represents the current condition of an endpoint.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointConditions/ready.yaml
ready indicates that this endpoint is ready to receive traffic, according to whatever system is managing the endpoint. A nil value should be interpreted as "true". In general, an endpoint should be marked ready if it is serving and not terminating, though this can be overridden in some cases, such as when the associated Service has set the publishNotReadyAddresses flag.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointConditions/serving.yaml
serving indicates that this endpoint is able to receive traffic, according to whatever system is managing the endpoint. For endpoints backed by pods, the EndpointSlice controller will mark the endpoint as serving if the pod's Ready condition is True. A nil value should be interpreted as "true".
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointConditions/terminating.yaml
terminating indicates that this endpoint is terminating. A nil value should be interpreted as "false".
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointHints/_EndpointHints.yaml
EndpointHints provides hints describing how an endpoint should be consumed.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointHints/forNodes.yaml
forNodes indicates the node(s) this endpoint should be consumed by when using topology aware routing. May contain a maximum of 8 entries. This is an Alpha feature and is only used when the PreferSameTrafficDistribution feature gate is enabled.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointHints/forZones.yaml
forZones indicates the zone(s) this endpoint should be consumed by when using topology aware routing. May contain a maximum of 8 entries.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointPort/_EndpointPort.yaml
EndpointPort represents a Port used by an EndpointSlice
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointPort/port.yaml
port represents the port number of the endpoint. If the EndpointSlice is derived from a Kubernetes service, this must be set to the service's target port. EndpointSlices used for other purposes may have a nil port.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointPort/protocol.yaml
protocol represents the IP protocol for this port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Default is TCP.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointSlice/_EndpointSlice.yaml
EndpointSlice represents a set of service endpoints. Most EndpointSlices are created by the EndpointSlice controller to represent the Pods selected by Service objects. For a given service there may be multiple EndpointSlice objects which must be joined to produce the full set of endpoints; you can find all of the slices for a given service by listing EndpointSlices in the service's namespace whose `kubernetes.io/service-name` label contains the service's name.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointSlice/addressType.yaml
addressType specifies the type of address carried by this EndpointSlice. All addresses in this slice must be the same type. This field is immutable after creation. The following address types are currently supported: * IPv4: Represents an IPv4 Address. * IPv6: Represents an IPv6 Address. * FQDN: Represents a Fully Qualified Domain Name. (Deprecated) The EndpointSlice controller only generates, and kube-proxy only processes, slices of addressType "IPv4" and "IPv6". No semantics are defined for the "FQDN" type.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointSlice/endpoints.yaml
endpoints is a list of unique endpoints in this slice. Each slice may include a maximum of 1000 endpoints.
===
discovery.k8s.io/EndpointSlice/ports.yaml
ports specifies the list of network ports exposed by each endpoint in this slice. Each port must have a unique name. Each slice may include a maximum of 100 ports. Services always have at least 1 port, so EndpointSlices generated by the EndpointSlice controller will likewise always have at least 1 port. EndpointSlices used for other purposes may have an empty ports list.
===
discovery.k8s.io/ForNode/_ForNode.yaml
ForNode provides information about which nodes should consume this endpoint.
===
discovery.k8s.io/ForNode/name.yaml
name represents the name of the node.
===
discovery.k8s.io/ForZone/_ForZone.yaml
ForZone provides information about which zones should consume this endpoint.
===
discovery.k8s.io/ForZone/name.yaml
name represents the name of the zone.
