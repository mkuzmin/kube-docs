    AllocationMode and its related fields define how devices are allocated to satisfy this request. Supported values are:

    - ExactCount: This request is for a specific number of devices.
      This is the default. The exact number is provided in the
      count field.

    - All: This request is for all of the matching devices in a pool.
      At least one device must exist on the node for the allocation to succeed.
      Allocation will fail if some devices are already allocated,
      unless adminAccess is requested.

    If AllocationMode is not specified, the default mode is ExactCount. If the mode is ExactCount and count is not specified, the default count is one. Any other requests must specify this field.

    More modes may get added in the future. Clients must refuse to handle requests with unknown modes.
