    BindingConditions defines the conditions for proceeding with binding. All of these conditions must be set in the per-device status conditions with a value of True to proceed with binding the pod to the node while scheduling the pod.

    The maximum number of binding conditions is 4.

    The conditions must be a valid condition type string.

    This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRADeviceBindingConditions and DRAResourceClaimDeviceStatus feature gates.
