    ConsumesCounters defines a list of references to sharedCounters and the set of counters that the device will consume from those counter sets.

    There can only be a single entry per counterSet.

    The total number of device counter consumption entries must be <= 32. In addition, the total number in the entire ResourceSlice must be <= 1024 (for example, 64 devices with 16 counters each).
