    BindingFailureConditions defines the conditions for binding failure. They may be set in the per-device status conditions. If any is set to "True", a binding failure occurred.

    The maximum number of binding failure conditions is 4.

    The conditions must be a valid condition type string.

    This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRADeviceBindingConditions and DRAResourceClaimDeviceStatus feature gates.
