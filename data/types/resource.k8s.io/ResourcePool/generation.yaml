    Generation tracks the change in a pool over time. Whenever a driver changes something about one or more of the resources in a pool, it must change the generation in all ResourceSlices which are part of that pool. Consumers of ResourceSlices should only consider resources from the pool with the highest generation number. The generation may be reset by drivers, which should be fine for consumers, assuming that all ResourceSlices in a pool are updated to match or deleted.

    Combined with ResourceSliceCount, this mechanism enables consumers to detect pools which are comprised of multiple ResourceSlices and are in an incomplete state.
