    MatchAttribute requires that all devices in question have this attribute and that its type and value are the same across those devices.

    For example, if you specified "dra.example.com/numa" (a hypothetical example!), then only devices in the same NUMA node will be chosen. A device which does not have that attribute will not be chosen. All devices should use a value of the same type for this attribute because that is part of its specification, but if one device doesn't, then it also will not be chosen.

    Must include the domain qualifier.
