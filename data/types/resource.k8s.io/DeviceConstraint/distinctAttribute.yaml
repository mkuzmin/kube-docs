    DistinctAttribute requires that all devices in question have this attribute and that its type and value are unique across those devices.
    
    This acts as the inverse of MatchAttribute.
    
    This constraint is used to avoid allocating multiple requests to the same device by ensuring attribute-level differentiation.
    
    This is useful for scenarios where resource requests must be fulfilled by separate physical devices. For example, a container requests two network interfaces that must be allocated from two different physical NICs.
