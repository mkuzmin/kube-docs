    ExtendedResourceName is the extended resource name for the devices of this class. The devices of this class can be used to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. It has the same format as the name of a pod's extended resource. It should be unique among all the device classes in a cluster. If two device classes have the same name, then the class created later is picked to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. If two classes are created at the same time, then the name of the class lexicographically sorted first is picked.

    This is an alpha field.
