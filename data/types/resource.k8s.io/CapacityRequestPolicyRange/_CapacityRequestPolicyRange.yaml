    CapacityRequestPolicyRange defines a valid range for consumable capacity values.
    
      - If the requested amount is less than Min, it is rounded up to the Min value.
      - If Step is set and the requested amount is between Min and Max but not aligned with Step,
        it will be rounded up to the next value equal to Min + (n * Step).
      - If Step is not set, the requested amount is used as-is if it falls within the range Min to Max (if set).
      - If the requested or rounded amount exceeds Max (if set), the request does not satisfy the policy,
        and the device cannot be allocated.
