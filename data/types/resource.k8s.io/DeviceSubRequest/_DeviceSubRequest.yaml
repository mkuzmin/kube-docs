    DeviceSubRequest describes a request for device provided in the claim.spec.devices.requests[].firstAvailable array. Each is typically a request for a single resource like a device, but can also ask for several identical devices.

    DeviceSubRequest is similar to ExactDeviceRequest, but doesn't expose the AdminAccess field as that one is only supported when requesting a specific device.
