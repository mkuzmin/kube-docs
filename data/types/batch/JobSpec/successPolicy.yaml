  original: successPolicy specifies the policy when the Job can be declared as succeeded.
    If empty, the default behavior applies - the Job is declared as succeeded only
    when the number of succeeded pods equals to the completions. When the field is
    specified, it must be immutable and works only for the Indexed Jobs. Once the
    Job meets the SuccessPolicy, the lingering pods are terminated.
