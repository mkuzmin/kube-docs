  original: ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished
    execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished
    after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job
    is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored.
    If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field
    is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes.
