description:
  original: suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not.
    If a Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job controller.
    If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to true),
    the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job. Users
    must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will reset
    the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds
    timer too. Defaults to false.
