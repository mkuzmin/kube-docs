  original: FailedIndexes holds the failed indexes when spec.backoffLimitPerIndex
    is set. The indexes are represented in the text format analogous as for the `completedIndexes`
    field, ie. they are kept as decimal integers separated by commas. The numbers
    are listed in increasing order. Three or more consecutive numbers are compressed
    and represented by the first and last element of the series, separated by a hyphen.
    For example, if the failed indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are represented
    as "1,3-5,7". The set of failed indexes cannot overlap with the set of completed
    indexes.
