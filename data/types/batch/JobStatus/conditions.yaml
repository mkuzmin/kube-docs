    The latest available observations of an object's current state. When a Job fails, one of the conditions will have type "Failed" and status true. When a Job is suspended, one of the conditions will have type "Suspended" and status true; when the Job is resumed, the status of this condition will become false. When a Job is completed, one of the conditions will have type "Complete" and status true.

    A job is considered finished when it is in a terminal condition, either "Complete" or "Failed". A Job cannot have both the "Complete" and "Failed" conditions. Additionally, it cannot be in the "Complete" and "FailureTarget" conditions. The "Complete", "Failed" and "FailureTarget" conditions cannot be disabled.
