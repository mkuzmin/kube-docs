flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/QueuingConfiguration/handSize.yaml
`handSize` is a small positive number that configures the shuffle sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request at this priority level the request's flow identifier (a string pair) is hashed and the hash value is used to shuffle the list of queues and deal a hand of the size specified here.  The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this field.  This field has a default value of 8.

`queues` is the number of queues for this priority level. The queues exist independently at each apiserver. The value must be positive.  Setting it to 1 effectively precludes shufflesharding and thus makes the distinguisher method of associated flow schemas irrelevant.  This field has a default value of 64.

===
flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/ResourcePolicyRule/namespaces.yaml
`namespaces` is a list of target namespaces that restricts matches.  A request that specifies a target namespace matches only if either (a) this list contains that target namespace or (b) this list contains "*".  Note that "*" matches any specified namespace but does not match a request that _does not specify_ a namespace (see the `clusterScope` field for that). This list may be empty, but only if `clusterScope` is true.
===
flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/ResourcePolicyRule/resources.yaml
`resources` is a list of matching resources (i.e., lowercase and plural) with, if desired, subresource.  For example, [ "services", "nodes/status" ].  This list may not be empty. "*" matches all resources and, if present, must be the only entry. Required.
