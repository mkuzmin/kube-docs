    x-kubernetes-map-type annotates an object to further describe its topology. This extension must only be used when type is object and may have 2 possible values:

    1) `granular`:
         These maps are actual maps (key-value pairs) and each fields are independent
         from each other (they can each be manipulated by separate actors). This is
         the default behaviour for all maps.
    2) `atomic`: the list is treated as a single entity, like a scalar.
         Atomic maps will be entirely replaced when updated.
