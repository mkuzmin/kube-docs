    x-kubernetes-list-type annotates an array to further describe its topology. This extension must only be used on lists and may have 3 possible values:

    1) `atomic`: the list is treated as a single entity, like a scalar.
         Atomic lists will be entirely replaced when updated. This extension
         may be used on any type of list (struct, scalar, ...).
    2) `set`:
         Sets are lists that must not have multiple items with the same value. Each
         value must be a scalar, an object with x-kubernetes-map-type `atomic` or an
         array with x-kubernetes-list-type `atomic`.
    3) `map`:
         These lists are like maps in that their elements have a non-index key
         used to identify them. Order is preserved upon merge. The map tag
         must only be used on a list with elements of type object.
    Defaults to atomic for arrays.
