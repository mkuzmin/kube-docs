  original: 'fieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails.
    It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location
    of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing
    field. e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`,
    the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo` If the validation checks two lists
    must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list:
    e.g. `.testList` It does not support list numeric index. It supports child operation
    to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/)
    for more info. Numeric index of array is not supported. For field name which contains
    special characters, use `[''specialName'']` to refer the field name. e.g. for
    attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to
    `.testList[''foo.34$'']`'
