  original: storedVersions lists all versions of CustomResources that were ever persisted.
    Tracking these versions allows a migration path for stored versions in etcd. The
    field is mutable so a migration controller can finish a migration to another version
    (ensuring no old objects are left in storage), and then remove the rest of the
    versions from this list. Versions may not be removed from `spec.versions` while
    they exist in this list.
