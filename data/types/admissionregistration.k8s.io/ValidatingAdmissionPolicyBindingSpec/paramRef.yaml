description:
  original: paramRef specifies the parameter resource used to configure the admission
    control policy. It should point to a resource of the type specified in ParamKind
    of the bound ValidatingAdmissionPolicy. If the policy specifies a ParamKind and
    the resource referred to by ParamRef does not exist, this binding is considered
    mis-configured and the FailurePolicy of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy applied.
    If the policy does not specify a ParamKind then this field is ignored, and the
    rules are evaluated without a param.
