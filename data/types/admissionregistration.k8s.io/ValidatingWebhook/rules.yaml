  original: Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook
    cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule. However,
    in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks
    from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely
    disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks
    are never called on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and
    MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
