    failurePolicy defines how to handle failures for the admission policy. Failures can occur from CEL expression parse errors, type check errors, runtime errors and invalid or mis-configured policy definitions or bindings.
    
    A policy is invalid if spec.paramKind refers to a non-existent Kind. A binding is invalid if spec.paramRef.name refers to a non-existent resource.
    
    failurePolicy does not define how validations that evaluate to false are handled.
    
    When failurePolicy is set to Fail, ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding validationActions define how failures are enforced.
    
    Allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.
