    If absent, there are no parameters for this policy and the param CEL variable
    will not be provided to validation expressions. If ParamKind refers to a non-existent
    kind, this policy definition is mis-configured and the FailurePolicy is applied.
    If paramKind is specified but paramRef is unset in ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding,
    the params variable will be null.
