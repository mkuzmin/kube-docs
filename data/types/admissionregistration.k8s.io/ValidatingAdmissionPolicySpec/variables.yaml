    Variables contain definitions of variables that can be used in composition of other expressions. Each variable is defined as a named CEL expression. The variables defined here will be available under `variables` in other expressions of the policy except MatchConditions because MatchConditions are evaluated before the rest of the policy.

    The expression of a variable can refer to other variables defined earlier in the list but not those after. Thus, Variables must be sorted by the order of first appearance and acyclic.
