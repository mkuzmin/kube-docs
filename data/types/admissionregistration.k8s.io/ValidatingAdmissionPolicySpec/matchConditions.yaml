    MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be validated. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.

    If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same manner as validation expressions.

    The exact matching logic is (in order):
      1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped.
      2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated.
      3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE):
         - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request
         - If failurePolicy=Ignore, the policy is skipped
