    Conditions contain conditions for PDB. The disruption controller sets the DisruptionAllowed condition. The following are known values for the reason field (additional reasons could be added in the future): - SyncFailed: The controller encountered an error and wasn't able to compute
                  the number of allowed disruptions. Therefore no disruptions are
                  allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
    - InsufficientPods: The number of pods are either at or below the number
                        required by the PodDisruptionBudget. No disruptions are
                        allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
    - SufficientPods: There are more pods than required by the PodDisruptionBudget.
                      The condition will be True, and the number of allowed
                      disruptions are provided by the disruptionsAllowed property.
