description:
  original: nodeID of the node from the driver point of view. This field enables Kubernetes
    to communicate with storage systems that do not share the same nomenclature for
    nodes. For example, Kubernetes may refer to a given node as "node1", but the storage
    system may refer to the same node as "nodeA". When Kubernetes issues a command
    to the storage system to attach a volume to a specific node, it can use this field
    to refer to the node name using the ID that the storage system will understand,
    e.g. "nodeA" instead of "node1". This field is required.
