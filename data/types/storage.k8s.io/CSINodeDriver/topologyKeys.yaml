description:
  original: topologyKeys is the list of keys supported by the driver. When a driver
    is initialized on a cluster, it provides a set of topology keys that it understands
    (e.g. "company.com/zone", "company.com/region"). When a driver is initialized
    on a node, it provides the same topology keys along with values. Kubelet will
    expose these topology keys as labels on its own node object. When Kubernetes does
    topology aware provisioning, it can use this list to determine which labels it
    should retrieve from the node object and pass back to the driver. It is possible
    for different nodes to use different topology keys. This can be empty if driver
    does not support topology.
