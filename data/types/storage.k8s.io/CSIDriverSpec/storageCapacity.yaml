    storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information, if set to true.
    
    The check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case, provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object.
    
    Alternatively, the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when storage capacity information has been published.
    
    This field was immutable in Kubernetes <= 1.22 and now is mutable.
