    nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds specifies the interval between periodic updates of the CSINode allocatable capacity for this driver. When set, both periodic updates and updates triggered by capacity-related failures are enabled. If not set, no updates occur (neither periodic nor upon detecting capacity-related failures), and the allocatable.count remains static. The minimum allowed value for this field is 10 seconds.
    
    This is a beta feature and requires the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate to be enabled.
    
    This field is mutable.
