  original: container resource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified
    in requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing a single container in each
    pod in the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are built in
    to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available to normal
    per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.
