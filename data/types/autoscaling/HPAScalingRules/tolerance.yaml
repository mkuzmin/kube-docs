    tolerance is the tolerance on the ratio between the current and desired metric value under which no updates are made to the desired number of replicas (e.g. 0.01 for 1%). Must be greater than or equal to zero. If not set, the default cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).

    For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi, and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.

    This is an alpha field and requires enabling the HPAConfigurableTolerance feature gate.
