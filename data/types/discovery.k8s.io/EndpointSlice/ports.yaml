    ports specifies the list of network ports exposed by each endpoint in this slice. Each port must have a unique name. Each slice may include a maximum of 100 ports. Services always have at least 1 port, so EndpointSlices generated by the EndpointSlice controller will likewise always have at least 1 port. EndpointSlices used for other purposes may have an empty ports list.
