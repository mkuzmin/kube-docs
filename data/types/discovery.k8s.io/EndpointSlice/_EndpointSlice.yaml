  original: EndpointSlice represents a set of service endpoints. Most EndpointSlices are created by the EndpointSlice controller to represent the Pods selected by Service objects. For a given service there may be multiple EndpointSlice objects which must be joined to produce the full set of endpoints;
    you can find all of the slices for a given service by listing EndpointSlices in the service's namespace whose `kubernetes.io/service-name` label contains the service's name.
