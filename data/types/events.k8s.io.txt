events.k8s.io/Event/_Event.yaml
Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some state change in the system. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time.  Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason.  Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.

===
events.k8s.io/EventSeries/count.yaml
count is the number of occurrences in this series up to the last heartbeat time.
===
