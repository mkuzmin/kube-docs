description:
  original: ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress
    controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving
    this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass
    -> Ingress resource). Although the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple
    constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress
    controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress
    resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However,
    even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility
    reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.
