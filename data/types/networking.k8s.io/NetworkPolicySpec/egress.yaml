  original: egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing
    traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster
    policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress
    rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod.
    If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and
    serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This
    field is beta-level in 1.8
