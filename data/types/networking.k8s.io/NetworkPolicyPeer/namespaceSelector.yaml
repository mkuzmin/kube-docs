    namespaceSelector selects namespaces using cluster-scoped labels. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all namespaces.

    If podSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the pods matching podSelector in the namespaces selected by namespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects all pods in the namespaces selected by namespaceSelector.
