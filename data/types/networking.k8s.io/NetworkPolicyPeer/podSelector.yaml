    podSelector is a label selector which selects pods. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all pods.
    
    If namespaceSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the pods matching podSelector in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects the pods matching podSelector in the policy's own namespace.
