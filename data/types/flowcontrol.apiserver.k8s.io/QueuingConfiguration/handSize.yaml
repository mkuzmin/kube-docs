description:
  original: '`handSize` is a small positive number that configures the shuffle sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request at this priority level the request''s flow identifier (a string pair) is hashed and the hash value is used to shuffle the list of queues and deal a hand of the size
    specified here.  The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing documentation for more extensive guidance on setting
    this field.  This field has a default value of 8.'
