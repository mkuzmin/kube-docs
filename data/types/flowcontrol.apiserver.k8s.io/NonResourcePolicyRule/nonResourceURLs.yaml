    `nonResourceURLs` is a set of url prefixes that a user should have access to and may not be empty. For example:
      - "/healthz" is legal
      - "/hea*" is illegal
      - "/hea" is legal but matches nothing
      - "/hea/*" also matches nothing
      - "/healthz/*" matches all per-component health checks.
    "*" matches all non-resource urls. if it is present, it must be the only entry. Required.
