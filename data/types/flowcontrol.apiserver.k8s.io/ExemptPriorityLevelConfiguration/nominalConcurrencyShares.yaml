    `nominalConcurrencyShares` (NCS) contributes to the computation of the NominalConcurrencyLimit (NominalCL) of this level. This is the number of execution seats nominally reserved for this priority level. This DOES NOT limit the dispatching from this priority level but affects the other priority levels through the borrowing mechanism. The server's concurrency limit (ServerCL) is divided among all the priority levels in proportion to their NCS values:

    NominalCL(i)  = ceil( ServerCL * NCS(i) / sum_ncs ) sum_ncs = sum[priority level k] NCS(k)

    Bigger numbers mean a larger nominal concurrency limit, at the expense of every other priority level. This field has a default value of zero.
