alias:: DeviceClassSpec

- DeviceClassSpec is used in a [DeviceClass] to define what can be allocated and how to configure it.

  heading:: true

  - `config` ([][[DeviceClassConfiguration]])
    - Config defines configuration parameters that apply to each device that is claimed via this class. Some classses may potentially be satisfied by multiple drivers, so each instance of a vendor configuration applies to exactly one driver.
      
      They are passed to the driver, but are not considered while allocating the claim.

  - `extendedResourceName` (string)
    - ExtendedResourceName is the extended resource name for the devices of this class. The devices of this class can be used to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. It has the same format as the name of a pod's extended resource. It should be unique among all the device classes in a cluster. If two device classes have the same name, then the class created later is picked to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. If two classes are created at the same time, then the name of the class lexicographically sorted first is picked.
      
      This is an alpha field.

  - `selectors` ([][[DeviceSelector]])
    - Each selector must be satisfied by a device which is claimed via this class.
