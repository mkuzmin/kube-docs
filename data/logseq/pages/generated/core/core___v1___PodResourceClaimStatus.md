alias:: PodResourceClaimStatus

- PodResourceClaimStatus is stored in the PodStatus for each PodResourceClaim which references a ResourceClaimTemplate. It stores the generated name for the corresponding ResourceClaim.

  heading:: true

  - `name` (string), **required**
    - Name uniquely identifies this resource claim inside the pod. This must match the name of an entry in pod.spec.resourceClaims, which implies that the string must be a DNS_LABEL.

  - `resourceClaimName` (string)
    - ResourceClaimName is the name of the ResourceClaim that was generated for the Pod in the namespace of the Pod. If this is unset, then generating a ResourceClaim was not necessary. The pod.spec.resourceClaims entry can be ignored in this case.
