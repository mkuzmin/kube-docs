# Planning Approach

## Go Slow, Think First

1. **Architecture before implementation** - Agree on high-level approach before discussing code details
2. **One problem at a time** - Don't jump ahead to future steps; focus on the immediate task
3. **Ask questions early** - Clarify scope, goals, and constraints before proposing solutions
4. **Verify claims** - Double-check numbers, counts, and assumptions with actual data

## Incremental Planning

- Don't deliver a "final plan" upfront
- Build understanding through conversation
- Use task lists for multi-step work
- Each step should be small and verifiable
- Follow-up refinements are normal iteration, not planning failures

## Scope Discipline

- Don't discuss Step 2 while planning Step 1
- Don't refactor code outside the task scope
- Don't "improve" code that works - only change what's necessary
- Keep the original code style unless asked to change it

## Plan Structure

A good plan answers:
- **What** is the goal?
- **What** is the current state?
- **What** is the target state?
- **How** to verify success?

Implementation details come after the approach is agreed upon.
