In this conversation what have we learned about the project and code what is not documented in claude.md files and rules. Reflect.

Update `claude.md` files (including ones in subdirectories) and files inside `.claude/rules/`. Do not pollute core `claude.md` with implementation details - find better place.

Rules should be prescriptive (what TO do), not descriptive (what the code currently does).
